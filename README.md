# Canny-Edge-Detector
 An edge detection algorithm coded from scratch, to remove noise and detect edges
 

 Instructions to run the program:
1. Download OpenCV for python, which can be directly added on Anaconda Navigator
or by executing the following command in the terminal: pip install opencv-python.
(Note: OpenCV package is just used to read and write images in the source code)
2. The other packages that must be installed are Math, Numpy and Os.
3. Open the source code in a code editor which supports python
4. Copy the image path whose edge is to be detected and assign it to the variable
image_path , line 13 , which is used to read the image.
5. Create a folder where you would like to store all the images produced by the project
and copy its path.
6. Copy the folder path and assign it to the variable output_path , line 16 , which is used
to save the image.
7. Run the program.
8. See the outputs in the folder created.
